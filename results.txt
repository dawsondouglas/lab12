Recursive appears to be at least a full 100 ns slower, barring rounding from my C++ build.
Reasoning for this is likely cleanup operations and function set-up whenever we re-call the function
for a new iteration. This would make using the types for C++ better than brute forcing the
operation by re-calling it.
